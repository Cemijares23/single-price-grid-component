## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - It's a good tool I found with a variety of predefined box shadows to apply directly in the code.
- [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) - Since this particular design had troubles with the default color palette, i extracted the exact colors with this tool.
- [Perfect Pixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) - Extension I always use to match as many details as i can to the desired design.
